```

## How to delete the git history

Checkout/create orphan branch (this branch won't show in git branch command):

```shell
git checkout --orphan latest_branch
```

See what you need to include

```shell
git status
git add -A # if you want to add all
git commit -am "clean history"
```

Delete main branch

```shell
git branch -D main
```

Rename the current branch to main

```shell
git branch -m main
```

See the remotes and push changes
This ensures you don't overwrite other people's work

```shell
git remote  -v
git push --force-with-lease REMOTE main
```
