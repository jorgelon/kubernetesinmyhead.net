## Linting

Linting refers to the process of analyzing your code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and other issues. It helps improve code quality and maintain consistency across your codebase.

Key Features of Linting in VS Code:

- Error Detection: Linters can detect syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors in your code.
- Code Style Enforcement: Linters enforce coding standards and style guidelines, ensuring that your code adheres to best practices.
- Real-time Feedback: As you write code, linters provide immediate feedback, highlighting issues directly in the editor.
- Fix Suggestions: Many linters offer suggestions for fixing detected issues, and some can even automatically apply fixes.

In order to enable linting in VS Code we need to install an extension via the VS Code Marketplace that provides a linter tool (linter) for our programming language.

Here we have a list of linters

Code completion is an vscode feature that provides suggestions and auto-completions to our code.

> Code completion is part of a wider feature called intellisense.

Key Features of Code Completion in VS Code:

- Auto-Suggestions: As you type, VS Code suggests possible completions for your code based on the context. This includes variable names, function names, class names, and more.

- Snippet Insertion: VS Code can insert code snippets, which are predefined templates for common code structures. This helps speed up coding by reducing repetitive typing.

- Parameter Info: When you type a function call, VS Code shows the function's parameters and their types, helping you understand what arguments are required.

- Quick Info: Hovering over a symbol provides additional information, such as documentation comments, type information, and more.

- Member Lists: When you type a dot after an object, VS Code shows a list of available members (methods, properties, etc.) for that object.

How to Use Code Completion in VS Code:

- Typing: Simply start typing, and VS Code will automatically show suggestions based on the context.
- Trigger Suggestions: You can manually trigger suggestions by pressing Ctrl + Space.
- Accepting Suggestions: Use the Tab or Enter key to accept a suggestion from the list.
