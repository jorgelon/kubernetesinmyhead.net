# Subagents

Subagents (also called agents) are custom AI assistants specialized for specific tasks. They can be managed through the `/agents` command and configured to handle particular workflows or domain-specific operations.

Subagents allow you to:

- Delegate specialized tasks to focused AI assistants
- Create reusable task-specific workflows
- Maintain consistency in how certain tasks are performed
- Scale complex operations across multiple focused agents
