**Requirements:** VS Code 1.98.0 or higher

### Add File to Context

With Claude Code in a secondary panel, focus an opened file tab and press `ALT+CTRL+K`. This adds that file to the context.

### Add Line to Context

With Claude Code in a secondary panel, select a line in an opened file and press `ALT+CTRL+K`. This adds that specific line to the context.

### Use Plan Mode for Complex Changes

Enable plan mode when working on complex features. Claude will present an implementation plan for you to review before making any changes.

### Review Changes Before Accepting

Use the diff view to review each change individually. You can accept or reject specific edits rather than all-or-nothing.

## Configuration

### Terminal Setup

Run `/terminal-setup` to automatically configure `Shift+Enter` to add a `\` (new line) in the terminal.
