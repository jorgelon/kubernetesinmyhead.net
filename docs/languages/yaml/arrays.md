# Arrays / lists

There are 2 ways to represent an array

```yaml
rebootDays: [mo,tu,we,th]
```

Block style (multi line format)

```yaml
rebootDays:
  - mo
  - tu
  - we
  - th
```

By using the block style, you can make the array more readable, especially when dealing with longer lists or more complex structures.
